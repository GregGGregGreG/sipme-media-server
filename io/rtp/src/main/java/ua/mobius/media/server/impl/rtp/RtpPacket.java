     * to allow synchronization and jitter calculations.

     * arrival jitter (one tick per video frame is typically not
     * sufficient).  The clock frequency is dependent on the format of
     * data carried as payload and is specified statically in the
     * profile or payload format specification that defines the format,
     * or may be specified dynamically for payload formats defined
     * through non-RTP means. If RTP packets are generated
     * periodically, the nominal sampling instant as determined from
     * the sampling clock is to be used, not a reading of the system
     * clock. As an example, for fixed-rate audio the timestamp clock
     * would likely increment by one for each sampling period.  If an
     * audio application reads blocks covering 160 sampling periods
     * from the input device, the timestamp would be increased by 160
     * for each such block, regardless of whether the block is
     * transmitted in a packet or dropped as silent.
     *
     * The initial value of the timestamp is random, as for the sequence
     * number. Several consecutive RTP packets may have equal timestamps if
     * they are (logically) generated at once, e.g., belong to the same
     * video frame. Consecutive RTP packets may contain timestamps that are
     * not monotonic if the data is not transmitted in the order it was
     * sampled, as in the case of MPEG interpolated video frames. (The
